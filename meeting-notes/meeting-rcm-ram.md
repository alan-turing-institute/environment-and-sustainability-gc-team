* Cass working on internal communication and cohesion

    * 15th November presenting something on SHM to Management Meeting
* NERC data centres - Environmental Data Service
    * Alden presented GC at monthly meeting
    * Suggestions for engagement/meetings:
        * How could researchers use all the data they have? (e.g. written data)
        * They want to deeeply understand how to make their data available and useful.
            * This could be a workshop at BMA House, maybe February.
            * Think about one really good use case in missions 1-2
                * Have them present to the data centres - workshop ideas
                    * First step describe what the EDCs have available, and match that with the projects we have
                    * Opportunity for people who run the data centres to get hands on with how we work. 
                    * This activity doesn't have to lead to anything conctrete, could just be understanding.


* Lots of interest in flooding - combines multiple different data sources and could then cross into Urban Analytics / DCE 

* ==What is the relationship between NERC EDS, and NERC Digital Solutions programme== (Manchester, David Topping and Richard Kingston)

* Knowledge Share
    * Webinar Series

* Kalle, Tom's project

* WS2.2 CROP + Sophie
